      Ember Lifeline supports a functional API that enables entanglement - <strong><i>the association of async behavior
          to object instances</i></strong>. This allows you to write async code in your classes that can be
      automatically cleaned up for you when the object is destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ember Lifeline's functions are, in most cases, drop-in replacements for runloop and DOM methods. In the example
      below, the `runTask` function schedules async work, but this work will be correctly canceled when the object is
      destroyed via the `runDisposables` call in `willDestroy`.
